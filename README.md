# RAW-Text-File-Parser
This is an implementation of a raw text file parser to generate a json and xml file containing only the required information
In this python code I have tried to read in a text file containing html format of some of the Monash university units information. The aim is to develop suitable Regex to obtain required information such as synopsis, unitcode, unit title and etc.

Using this data I then create to output files for json and XML format to represent the data in developing these outputs I was restricted to use of any Python existing libraries and had to develop the function to build the required structures for both json and XML files. the output of which has been presented here as a Jupyter notebook document.
